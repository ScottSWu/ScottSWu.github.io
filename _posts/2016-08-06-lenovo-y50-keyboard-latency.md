I've had the y50 for two years now, and other than the hard drive (which I later swapped out with an SSD), it's been pretty nifty and reliable. One peeve I still have is that the laptop's keyboard is slow. While playing osu!, there is a clear audio delay in feedback, eyeballing around 30-50ms. You can try this for yourself by turning off hitsounds, and playing purely by ear.
