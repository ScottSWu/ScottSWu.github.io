Today is the last day of my 10 week summer work. Over the 10 weeks, I frequently cooked / made meals to save money on food. Every now and then I would still eat out with friends. Going through all the receipts, I found that cooking saved me about 7 dollars per meal.

On average, a meal at a restaurant cost anywhere from 8 to 10 dollars. Purchasing materials from Wegmans averaged to about 2 or 3 dollars per meal.
