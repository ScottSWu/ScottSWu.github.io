Fume extractors can get expensive, but I really need to solder so it's important that I have one. I had a 140mm fan lying around and a 12V power adapter, so the only remaining parts needed were filters and a case.

## Fan

[Noctua NF-A14](http://a.co/d/9KGFdka) is a 140mm fan that runs at 2.16 W (12V, 0.18A). We can find its dimensions on the [Noctua](https://noctua.at/en/140mm_frame_types) [website](https://noctua.at/en/nf-a14-flx/specification).

## Filters

Cheap [carbon](http://a.co/d/5adtRrD) [filters](http://a.co/d/hPxo6yd) are available on Amazon, but not of great quality (if you feel them, they're not as stiff as the filters that come with the [Hakko extractor](http://a.co/d/1fzKpsi), for example). It's good to use two filters instead of one.

## Case

There are a couple cases available on Thingiverse, but most of them are for 120mm fans, and scaling up means the filters don't fit nicely anymore.

## Power Adapter

Any 12V or even 9V barrel connector power adapter should do. 5.5mm barrel connectors cost less than a dollar each. The power and ground can be hooked up directly to the fan.

Success!
