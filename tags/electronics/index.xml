      <title>DIY Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>Fume extractors can get expensive, but I really need to solder so it&amp;rsquo;s important that I have one. I had a 140mm fan lying around and a 12V power adapter, so the only remaining parts needed were filters and a case.
Fan Noctua NF-A14 is a 140mm fan that runs at 2.16 W (12V, 0.18A). We can find its dimensions on the Noctua website.
Filters Cheap carbon filters are available on Amazon, but not of great quality (if you feel them, they&amp;rsquo;re not as stiff as the filters that come with the Hakko extractor, for example).</description>

      <description>The PSU that came with my Prusa MK3 kit had a strange rattling sound as I picked it up. Sure enough, the large capacitor was loose inside.

Sure enough after taking out the PCB, the leads seem to have broken free from the solder. Since this was &amp;ldquo;QC Checked&amp;rdquo;, this may have happened in during shipment. Prusa support was very nice, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait for a replacement.</description>

      <description>For this year&amp;rsquo;s graduation, I decided to decorate my cap with a little more than a sticker.
{% include figure image_path=&amp;quot;graduation_cap.jpg&amp;rdquo; %}
Motor The first step into planning was deciding what motor to use. I wanted the electronics to be as simple as possible.
 Cheap DC motors (that were available) were difficult to mount onto the cap I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a brushless quadcopter motor chopping off fingers Stepper motors were too heavy and needed an extra driver board  I ended up removing the blades on a PC cooling fan.</description>
