      <description>On my way back from Miami, we were delayed 3 hours having to detour around a storm and having to add enough fuel to manage the detour.

      <description>During my visit to the Grand Canyon, I saw a number of birds flying around. Like birds in large cities, they did not fly away immediately.
An overheard conversation:
 Child: What do ravens make? Father: Well, eggs, nests, poems&amp;hellip;

      <description>Today is the last day of my 10 week summer work. Over the 10 weeks, I frequently cooked / made meals to save money on food. Every now and then I would still eat out with friends. Going through all the receipts, I found that cooking saved me about 7 dollars per meal.
On average, a meal at a restaurant cost anywhere from 8 to 10 dollars. Purchasing materials from Wegmans averaged to about 2 or 3 dollars per meal.</description>
