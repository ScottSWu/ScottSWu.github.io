      <title>DIY Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>Fume extractors can get expensive, but I really need to solder so it&amp;rsquo;s important that I have one. I had a 140mm fan lying around and a 12V power adapter, so the only remaining parts needed were filters and a case.
Fan Noctua NF-A14 is a 140mm fan that runs at 2.16 W (12V, 0.18A). We can find its dimensions on the Noctua website.
Filters Cheap carbon filters are available on Amazon, but not of great quality (if you feel them, they&amp;rsquo;re not as stiff as the filters that come with the Hakko extractor, for example).</description>

      <title>Propeller Graduation Cap</title>

      <description>For this year&amp;rsquo;s graduation, I decided to decorate my cap with a little more than a sticker.
{% include figure image_path=&amp;quot;graduation_cap.jpg&amp;rdquo; %}
Motor The first step into planning was deciding what motor to use. I wanted the electronics to be as simple as possible.
 Cheap DC motors (that were available) were difficult to mount onto the cap I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a brushless quadcopter motor chopping off fingers Stepper motors were too heavy and needed an extra driver board  I ended up removing the blades on a PC cooling fan.</description>
