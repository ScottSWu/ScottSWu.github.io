      <title>DIY Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>Fume extractors can get expensive, but I really need to solder so it&amp;rsquo;s important that I have one. I had a 140mm fan lying around and a 12V power adapter, so the only remaining parts needed were filters and a case.
Fan Noctua NF-A14 is a 140mm fan that runs at 2.16 W (12V, 0.18A). We can find its dimensions on the Noctua website.
Filters Cheap carbon filters are available on Amazon, but not of great quality (if you feel them, they&amp;rsquo;re not as stiff as the filters that come with the Hakko extractor, for example).</description>

      <title>Propeller Graduation Cap</title>

      <description>For this year&amp;rsquo;s graduation, I decided to decorate my cap with a little more than a sticker.
{% include figure image_path=&amp;quot;graduation_cap.jpg&amp;rdquo; %}
Motor The first step into planning was deciding what motor to use. I wanted the electronics to be as simple as possible.
 Cheap DC motors (that were available) were difficult to mount onto the cap I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a brushless quadcopter motor chopping off fingers Stepper motors were too heavy and needed an extra driver board  I ended up removing the blades on a PC cooling fan.</description>

      <title>Rendering Canvas to mp4 using NodeJS</title>

      <description>I recently put together a &amp;ldquo;it just works&amp;rdquo; version of WOsu and WOsu-record.
WOsu is a JavaScript library for the rhythm game osu!. Although designed to use any sort of rendering (Canvas, CSS), its working implementation primarily relies on Three.js and WebGL.
Currently the primary use of WOsu is the Web osu! Replay Viewer, which allows users to view replays straight on the web.
WOsu-record is an Electron application that uses WOsu, ffmpeg and nodejs to record replays to a video file.</description>
