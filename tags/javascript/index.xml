      <description>I was looking for an easy way to access an IMU for some quick tests. I settled on a smartphone sensor because all the sensor fusion / calibration software is built in. Furthermore, the device motion and device orientation events available in the Web API make it easy to grab the data, send it to a computer through websockets and then pipe it into any application.
Device Orientation: {% highlight javascript %} window.</description>

      <description>I recently put together a &amp;ldquo;it just works&amp;rdquo; version of WOsu and WOsu-record.
WOsu is a JavaScript library for the rhythm game osu!. Although designed to use any sort of rendering (Canvas, CSS), its working implementation primarily relies on Three.js and WebGL.
Currently the primary use of WOsu is the Web osu! Replay Viewer, which allows users to view replays straight on the web.
WOsu-record is an Electron application that uses WOsu, ffmpeg and nodejs to record replays to a video file.</description>
