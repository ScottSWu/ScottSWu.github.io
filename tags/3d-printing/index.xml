      <description>I finished a 1000 piece Princess Mononoke puzzle purchased from Japan. After applying the puzzle glue and sticking it onto a poster board, I needed to mount it on my wall.

Not wanting a full frame, I instead printed some hooks that would hold the poster board up from the top and bottom. I attached the hooks to my wall using command strips.

      <description>For this year&amp;rsquo;s graduation, I decided to decorate my cap with a little more than a sticker.
{% include figure image_path=&amp;quot;graduation_cap.jpg&amp;rdquo; %}
Motor The first step into planning was deciding what motor to use. I wanted the electronics to be as simple as possible.
 Cheap DC motors (that were available) were difficult to mount onto the cap I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a brushless quadcopter motor chopping off fingers Stepper motors were too heavy and needed an extra driver board  I ended up removing the blades on a PC cooling fan.</description>
