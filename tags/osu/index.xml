      <description>A long proposed osu! multiplayer feature is to allow players to play different difficulties within the same beatmap set. In a casual setting, players of different skill levels can enjoy multiplayer together without having to worry about a map being too difficult for one, or too easy for another. This is especially the case when introducing friends who are new to the game.
osu! uses MD5 hashes of .osu files to lookup beatmaps.</description>

Some notes from this experience:
 My eyes typically move to the next notes before my cursor I use my peripherals and muscle memory for large jumps  Future things to try:

      <title>Lenovo y50 Keyboard Latency</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the y50 for two years now, and other than the hard drive (which I later swapped out with an SSD), it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty nifty and reliable. One peeve I still have is that the laptop&amp;rsquo;s keyboard is slow. While playing osu!, there is a clear audio delay in feedback, eyeballing around 30-50ms. You can try this for yourself by turning off hitsounds, and playing purely by ear.</description>
