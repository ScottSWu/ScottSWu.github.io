Some notes from this experience:
 My eyes typically move to the next notes before my cursor I use my peripherals and muscle memory for large jumps  Future things to try:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the y50 for two years now, and other than the hard drive (which I later swapped out with an SSD), it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty nifty and reliable. One peeve I still have is that the laptop&amp;rsquo;s keyboard is slow. While playing osu!, there is a clear audio delay in feedback, eyeballing around 30-50ms. You can try this for yourself by turning off hitsounds, and playing purely by ear.</description>
